## Installation

## Usage
### Authentication
This documentation assumes you have already obtained a client id and client secret from Sage.

To make any requests to the Sage One API, you must present an OAuth access token. The basic flow for obtaining a token for a user is as follows:

```ruby
# The code below is over-simplified. Read Sage's own API docs and the documentation for SageOne::Oauth to get
# a better idea of how to implement this in the context of your own app.
SageOne.configure do |c|
  c.client_id     = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_OBTAINED_FROM_SAGE"
  c.client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_OBTAINED_FROM_SAGE"
end

# Redirect the current user to SageOne. This will give them the choice to link SageOne with your app.
# and subsequently redirect them back to your callback_url with an authorisation_code if they choose to do so.
redirect_to SageOne.authorize_url('https://www.example.com/your_callback_url')

# Then, in the callback URL controller, run get_access_token, i.e.
response = SageOne.get_access_token(params[:code], 'https://www.example.com/your_callback_url')
User.save_access_token(response.access_token) unless response.access_token.nil?
```

### Standard API requests
Once you have an access token, configure the client with it, along with your client id and secret, and you're good to go:

```ruby
SageOne.configure do |c|
  c.client_id     = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_OBTAINED_FROM_SAGE"
  c.client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_OBTAINED_FROM_SAGE"
  c.access_token  = current_user.access_token
end

# Get an array of all sales invoices
invoices = SageOne.sales_invoices

# Add search params
SageOne.sales_invoices(status: 2, contact: 65489)

# Dates in search params...
# The SageOne API requires that you specify dates as dd/mm/yyyy
SageOne.sales_invoices(from_date: '21/11/2011')

# We simplify this by also allowing you to specify a date-like object (anything that responds to strftime)
SageOne.sales_invoices(from_date: 2.weeks.ago)  #rails

# Note that we can't protect you from doing the wrong thing with ambiguous dates..
SageOne.sales_invoices(from_date: '05/01/2012') # Hope that you meant 5th January and not 1st May
```
You can configure the `SageOne` client on the fly. For example, if you'd prefer to configure your client_id and secret in an
initializer then set the access_token in a controller:

```ruby
SageOne.new(access_token: current_user.access_token).sales_invoices
```

### Pagination
You can request any 'page' of results returned from the API by adding `start_index: n` to any API call:

```ruby
SageOne.sales_invoices(start_index: 30)
SageOne.sales_invoices(start_date: '28/02/2010', start_index: 50)

```

You can also turn on 'auto traversal' to have the client recursively get a full result set. Beware of using this on large result sets.

```ruby
# Recursively request ALL sales invoices, appending them to the body of the request
SageOne.new(auto_traversal: true).sales_invoices
```

### Other usage notees
- HTTP 1.1 requires that you set a Host: header. Whilst the gem will currently work fine without this, if conformance to the spec is important to you, set this with `request_host=`
- You can set a proxy server with `proxy=`
- To obtain raw, unprocessed responses back from the API, specify `raw_responses = true`. Read the documentation for more information on this.
